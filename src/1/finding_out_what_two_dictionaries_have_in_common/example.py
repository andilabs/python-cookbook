# 4.10.1. Dictionary view objects

# The objects returned by dict.keys(), dict.values() and dict.items() are view objects. 
# They provide a dynamic view on the dictionaryâ€™s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, 
# the view reflects these changes.
# Dictionary views can be iterated over to yield their respective data, and support membership tests
